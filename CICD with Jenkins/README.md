# What is CI, CD and CDE
---
CI — Continuous Integration
CD — Continuous Delivery
CDE - Continuous Deployment

## What is the differences between CD and CDE use cases?
---
### Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery is an extension of continuous integration to make sure that you can release new changes to your customers quickly in a sustainable way. This means that on top of having automated your testing, you also have automated your release process and you can deploy your application at any point of time by clicking on a button. In continuous Delivery the deployment is completed manually.


### Continuous Deployment
---
Continuous Deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery, with this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers, there is no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.




## What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration. Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build will take place. The following flowchart demonstrates a very simple workflow of how Jenkins works. Along with Jenkins, sometimes, one might also see the association of Hudson.
## What are the benefits of CICD pipeline
---
What is a CI CD Pipeline: The CI/CD pipeline is all about automation: Initiating code builds, automated testing, and automated deploying to the staging or production environments. It’s complex and exciting at the same time, but incredibly fast, if the output of any stage fails, the next stage will also fail.

## Why Jenkins
---
Why Jenkins? Multi Billion Dollar companies like Facebook, Netflix and Ebay have adopted Jenkins because of it’s amazing advantages, Jenkins is an open-source automation server in which the central build and CI process take place, It is a Java-based program with packages for Windows, macOS, & Linux.

Docker is the one of the best virtualization platform to containerise your app, popularity and adoption of Docker is rapidly growing due to its incredible benefits! Top companies like ING, Paypal, ADP, and Spotify keep using Docker. Continuous Integration Efficiency with Docker enables you to build a container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process. A huge benefit of this is the ability to separate non-dependent steps and run them in parallel, running applications in containers instead of virtual machines is gaining momentum in the IT industry.

Docker does really make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers, and containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and dependencies, ship it all out as one package
